# augment-it

Twice the dataset, _same_ time for annotation!

### Why?

Data augmentation is fundamental for a good object detection model. The problem is, the most boring part of object detection is annotating the dataset 
(e.g. using https://pypi.org/project/labelImg/ for YOLO model), and having to do it multiple times because for slightly different images feels like
something that should be done automatically. And so it is (from now on)!
